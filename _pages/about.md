About me
======

I am a doctoral student at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.uu.se/en/department/statistics) at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en), expected to finish by the fall of 2025. The main focus of my thesis is *compromise estimation*, which concerns weighted averages (or model averages) such as $$\bar \mu = \sum_k w_k \hat \mu_k,$$ where $w_k$ are model specific weights and $\hat \mu_k$ are candidate estimates of $\mu$, some quantity of interest.

I have a frequentist background, but I like working with Bayesian theory as much as I can. In particular, I enjoy working in the intersection of frequentism and Bayesianism, looking to establish connections and give frequentist motivations of Bayesian methods.

Feel free to get in touch by sending an e-mail to `firstname`.`surname`@`statistik.uu.se`.
