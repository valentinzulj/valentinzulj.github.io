About me
======

I am a doctoral student at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.uu.se/en/department/statistics) at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en), expected to finish by the fall of 2025. The main focus of my thesis is *compromise estimation*, which concerns compromise estimates (or model averages) such as $$\bar \mu = \sum_k w_k \hat \mu_k$$.
